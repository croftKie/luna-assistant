<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Luna Assistant is the open source version of my own voice assistant. Written in python with the use of as many core modules and open source modules as possible to create a voice assistant with limited exposure to data collection and increased personal privacy.
- Contains a range of responses and topics to keep answers fresh and engaging.
- Search the web and a range of websites (YouTube, images, etc) via voice command.
- Load up pre-saved browser tabs for improved productivity.
- Check the time and perform maths calculations.
- Much more to come.

Key Points:

- Written in Python.
- Focused on core system manipulation and open source modules.
- Lightweight script size.
- Prioritises user privacy and saves no user data to the cloud.
- Provides speech-to-text and text-to-speech options.
